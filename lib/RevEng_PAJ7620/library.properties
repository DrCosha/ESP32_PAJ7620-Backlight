sentence=Arduino library to provide a driver and API for the PixArt PAJ7620 (PAJ7620U2 or PAJ7620F2) integrated gesture recognition sensor.
paragraph=The PAJ7620 (U2 and F2) sensor provides simple motion-based gesture recognition. The IR-based object sensing can detect objects moving in front of the sensor. The sensor has 9 built-in gestures. This driver provides an object oriented interface to the I2C controlled device which has all 9 gestures, wave counting, TWI/I2C bus selection, and device enable/disable via APIs.
